Welcome to Blof project documentation.

## What is Blof?

Blof is a platform that provides professionally crafted markdown(MDX) blog templates and services
to developers and development teams.

Learn more on [the blof website](https://blof.dev).


## Important note.

I trust you're here because you just purchase a Blof blog template. Kindly note that this documentation 
is still very much in progress. This is currently being sorted out.

If you encounter any issue with setting up and getting started with using your Blof blog template and can't 
find the needed help here on the docs, please feel free to send me an email 
here: **blof.dev@gmail.com**. You can equally send a 
[DM on twitter](https://x.com/blof_dev) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/blof-dev/). 

I'll be glad to hop on a quick video call to help sort out any issues.
