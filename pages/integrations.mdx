# Integrations(Coming soon).
 
Beyond just providing professionally crafted markdown(MDX) blog templates, Blof plans to provide integrations for 
blogs - whether your blog was built with a Blof template or not. This will be very helpful for users with simple and static blogs that do 
not have backends.

Blof integrations are simple and straigthforward additions to your blog - which will be powered by API end-points.

Blof hopes to support integrations for:

1. Comments.
2. Post Reactions.
3. Post Bookmarking.
4. Post page visits/hits.
5. And hopefully more.

> Follow Blof on [twitter](https://x.com/blof_dev) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/blof-dev/) to stay updated and not miss out 
once the integrations service goes live.

Cheers!!!
